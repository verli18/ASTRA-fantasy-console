Astra is a fantasy console inspired by mid-90s design principles and limitations! It features a 32-bit custom RISC CPU, quad-based rendering engine and a math accelerator.

The system is still under development, this repository mainly contains documentation for it and an emulator I'm slowly chipping away at.
